            <p class="card-p">Aiming to Avoid Console Wars
                Microsoft seems to be positioning the next Xbox to avoid direct competition with Sony’s next PlayStation. By launching in 2026, they hope to sidestep the intense console wars that marked previous generations. The latest PlayStation at that time is expected to be the PlayStation 5 Pro, which would not pose an immediate threat to the new Xbox.
                
                The current Xbox Series X|S consoles have struggled to showcase their full potential. Despite their superior hardware capabilities, they lack a robust lineup of exclusive games. Notable titles include Starfield, Hellblade 2, Avowed, Gears 6, and an upcoming Indiana Jones game. Microsoft hopes that the next-gen console will leverage these titles and new ones to succeed where the Series X|S fell short.
                
                This report aligns with previous rumors hinting at a 2026 release for the next-gen Xbox. Although these reports remain unconfirmed, they suggest a strategic move by Microsoft to regain its footing in the console market. As the gaming community speculates about the future of Xbox, only time will tell how this new strategy will unfold.</p>

            <p class="card-head">Sony’s PS5 Pro is real and developers are getting ready for it</p>
            <p class="card-p">Sony is getting ready to release a more powerful PS5 console, possibly by the end of this year. After reports of leaked PS5 Pro specifications surfaced recently, The Verge has obtained a full list of specs for the upcoming console. Sources familiar with Sony’s plans tell me that developers are already being asked to ensure their games are compatible with this upcoming console, with a focus on improving ray tracing.</p>

            <p class="card-head">Console Generations Are A Dying Concept</p>
            <p class="card-p">We’re around midway through the ‘current generation’, based on past experience, and yet only half of PlayStation users have made the upgrade to PS5. It’s easy to see why, since most ‘exclusives’ are still backwards-compatible and the two consoles don’t feel as significant a leap as the PS1 to PS2 or the PS2 to PS3.

                The PS5 boasts faster load times and better lighting, but this is lackluster when compared to the PS1 introducing the revolutionary second joystick and character models going from polygon potatoes to identifiable objects with the PS2, something which was taken to its peak with the PS3 and PS4 as we approached near-photorealism. After that, there’s not much further we can go.</p>

            <p class="card-p">Nintendo has finally broken its silence on the successor to its smash-hit Switch - but don't get too excited.

                Fans have been eagerly awaiting news on the console for months, but little official information has emerged.
                
                Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has now promised an announcement at some point before March 2025.
                
                But he also said there would be no mention of the new machine at the company's Nintendo Direct event next month.
                
                In a post on X, the boss of the Japanese company, said: "It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015."

            <p class="card-p">It’s really hard to understate exactly how influential the original System Shock was, 30 years on from its original release. It launched only a year after the original Doom, and six months after The Elder Scrolls: Arena. This was fertile new ground for PC games, but System Shock was more dynamic than anything that had come before. It allowed you to pick up and place items around the world, you could interact with any object in view – regardless of whether or not it does anything – and you could actually move your camera up and down.</p>

            <p class="card-head">Sony could release a new handheld console that supports PS4 games</p>
            <p class="card-p">In addition, Logvinov claimed that the PSP-like console will support PS4 games at launch, likening the device to a Steam Deck, which is somewhat similar to what MLID said in February. MLID stated that the handheld console will be equipped with a customised AMD accelerated processing unit. It will also be backwards compatible with digital versions of PS4 games, and run PS5 games through "PS5 Pro-like upgrade patches." He hinted that the device will be part of PlayStation's next-generation hardware family, possibly launching alongside the PS6 or later.

                During a recent earnings call, Sony Interactive Entertainment revealed that half of PlayStation’s monthly active players are still playing on old consoles. As of March 31, 2024, SONY has sold 59.2 million PS5 units and stated that 118 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network are distributed between PS5 and old consoles (mainly PS4).</p>

            <p class="card-p">Here’s when you can start playing the next big Xbox first-party release, and the long-awaited sequel to 2017’s Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice.

                It’s not been a great year for huge Xbox exclusives, truth be told. Thankfully, this looks to finally change tomorrow when the highly anticipated (and awkwardly titled) Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 finally releases simultaneously on Xbox Series X|S and PC. Sure, both developer and publisher have been honest about this sequel being a relatively short experience, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth checking out for players who enjoy a gripping narrative and some seriously impressive visuals.</p>

The hobby I’ve loved my whole life is being ruined by greedy decisions made by selfish people. Whether through evil or stupidity, video games are being destroyed by the very people who claim to make them. As much as I want to stay excited and engaged as a fan, I’m afraid that some of these corporate decisions have made me want to leave gaming entirely. I’m disgusted. I’m upset. I’m offended.</p>
