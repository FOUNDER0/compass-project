            <p class="card-p">Introducing Lenovo’s latest groundbreaking innovation proof of concept, the Lenovo ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop Concept. This laptop revolutionizes the interaction and creation experience with its remarkable 17.3-inch Micro-LED transparent display. With a borderless screen, transparent keyboard area, and a seemingly floating footpad design, it effortlessly exudes a sense of high-tech simplicity, elevating the user’s overall experience.

                The brilliance of this laptop lies in its intelligent integration of the virtual and real. Through the power of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), the transparent screen opens up new avenues of work collaboration and efficiency by enabling the interaction with physical objects and overlaying digital information to create unique user generated content. The transparency allows it to effortlessly integrate naturally within its environment. Users can seamlessly switch between the keyboard and drawing board with a supported pen, unlocking new levels of creative efficiency. AI in combination with transparent displays will open up new ways of engaging with data and applications, offering opportunities to develop new features and form factors.</p>

            <p class="card-p">After previously testing both the new 14-inch and 16-inch models of the latest XPS series, it is now time to take a look at the compact Dell XPS 13 9340. The old XPS 13 Plus, which inspired the new models' design, is no longer available. However, Dell offers a slimmed-down XPS 13 9315 with old Alder Lake processors as well as conventional input devices—apart from this, they have an identical case.

                Our test device is fitted with the new Meteor Lake processor—the Core Ultra 7 155H—as well as 32 GB RAM, a 512-GB PCIe SSD and a Full HD panel. Dell's asking price for this configuration is US$1,599 (introductory price with the Core Ultra 5 and 16 GB RAM is US$1,149). You can raise this price to a maximum of US$2,659 (Core Ultra 7, 64 GB RAM, 2-TB SSD, QHD+).</p>

            <p class="card-p">Apple has given a lot of love to its MacBook Pro line in 2023. It doesn't feel like all that long ago I was writing the reviews of the MacBook Pro M2 Pro/Max model, so it's a little strange to be talking about the upgrade to those models not even a year later.
                
                Still, that's where we are, and while there isn't too much new to say about the design of the new MacBook Pro models - just like there wasn't with the iMac 2023 - there is plenty to say about performance. Just like its predecessor, the MacBook Pro (M3 Pro/Max) is an absolute powerhouse of a laptop that applies to both the 14-inch and 16-inch models, which have some serious configuration options. Should you buy the new MacBook Pro? Well, that very much depends. Here's my review.</p>
